# Purpose


**An outline of my career ambitions and a plan on how to achieve these goals**


My name is JB Mugi. I am a sci-tech enthusiast with a background in Applied Bioengineering, currently pursuing a BSc. Electronics and Computer Engineering. In addition to this, I am an intern at icipe under the 4th cohort of the Bioinformatics Internship and Mentorship program looking to learn and gain fundamental knowledge in the field of Bioinformatics which is an integral part of my career ambitions that are premised on the potential benefits that could be realised through the effective generation, analysis, interpretation, manipulation, sharing and secure storage of genomic data and information with the help of Bioinformatics and Computer engineering.
