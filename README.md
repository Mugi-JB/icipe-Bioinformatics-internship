### Hi 
I am JB Mugi, an ambitious Sci-Tech enthusiast with a background in the fields of **Biochemistry** and **Computer Engineering**, really interested in the effective generation, analysis, sharing/open Science and the secure storage of multi-omics data and information with the help of Bioinformatics and Computer engineering for an enhanced scientific research and development process.

I am currently a Bioinformatics intern at the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology, **_icipe_** under EANBiT's [Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship Program](https://eanbit.icipe.org/?page_id=1664) (cohort 4).


## MISSION
To Develop Bioinformatics tools with an intuitive and outstanding user interface, and a meaningful user experience through cutting-edge technology  for both scientists with the technical computational biology knowledge and those without.

## VISION
To put Bioinformatics tools in the hands of more scientists.

## CORE VALUES
- Integrity
- Respect
- Responsibility
- Commitment
- Passion
- Honesty

## Roadmap
This is an outline of the objectives I have for the [Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship Program](https://eanbit.icipe.org/?page_id=1664).

### Objectives
* Gain a fundamental understanding of bioinformatics and the intricacies involved in handling and manipulating biological data to develop and enhance Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools for those with little to no programming experience, to ease the analysis of biological data.
* Have a mentor in the development of computational tools for expanding the use of biological data, and open science.
* Adopt a collaborative approach to my problem-solving system and learn to make my work more reproducible.
* Apply programming languages, R and python, in manipulating biological data/sequencing data.
* Improve my communication skills.

### Milestones
* Participate in Journal Club Presentations
* Work on a Bioinformatics Mini-Projects
* Engage and contribute to discussions and workspaces relevant to bioinformatics and computational biology
* Identify and engage potential mentors on topics related to my interests
